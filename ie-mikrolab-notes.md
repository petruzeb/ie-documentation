# Mikrolab data analysis

## description
This MVP explores our ability to accept data from third party. Complete and correct the data, run eploratory data analysis and visualize the data in the form of basic charts. This MVP was implemented in order to facilitate discussion with the Mikrolab team. Significant part of the processing uses the AWS services in order to demonstrate public cloud capability.
